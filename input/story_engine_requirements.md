# Story Engine Requirements

1. Implement a data structure to represent story segments, choices, and outcomes
2. Create API endpoints for:
   - Starting a new story
   - Retrieving the current story segment
   - Making a choice and progressing the story
   - Saving and loading story progress
3. Implement in-memory storage for story progression (to be replaced with database storage later)
4. Ensure the engine can handle branching narratives
5. Implement a simple scripting system for basic story logic (e.g., if-then conditions)
